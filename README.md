# Cryptocurrency-price-prediction-Project
I have completed my academic project the topic called CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICE PREDICTION.I play the team leader role of our project.The tool used for project is Anaconda Navigator While using the Juypter Notebook.The Bitcoin price prediction can be done using LSTM and GRU algorithm,accuracy compared to show the best algorithm for prediction. The main goal is to test the ability of the algorithm to predict the values.caluculate the MAE and 
RMSE error for both GRU and LSTM algorithms.
