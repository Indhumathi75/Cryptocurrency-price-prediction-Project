# Cryptocurrency-price-prediction-Project
The system has been developed using Python's machine learning
capabilities."
We utilized Anaconda Navigator to manage the project and
collaborated with colleagues using Jupyter Notebook. We
compared the accuracy of LSTM and GRU algorithms to
determine the best algorithm for prediction.
We achieved the best goal of showcasing our
project
The goal is to test the ability of the algorithm to predict values.
Split the time series into training and validation sets with 80%
and 20% respectively to calculate the MAE and RMSE errors for
both GRU and LSTM algorithms.
